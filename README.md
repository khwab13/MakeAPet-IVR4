Making a quadrupted robot(a for leg pet robot)

First we learn how to use Matlab and Simulink so that we can analyse the data which we get from the sensors attached on our robot . It also helps in doing calculation with very ease
We can also create maps by using matlab and simulink. 

After doing this we install ROS noetic and then install champ from the online repositries and then we import gazebo world and rviz with the robot present in it.

Then we also make our own gazebo worlds and tried to importing it in our gazebo worlds

We also try to add some sensors in it such as lidar , ir sensor, etc.
